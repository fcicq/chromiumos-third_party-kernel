* Rockchip rk3288 Interconnect Service Bus

This device contains registers to control the memory scheduler on
rk3288 SoCs.  It is accessed during DDRFreq transitions and also at
suspend/resume.

Downstream this is sometimes referred to as the NoC (network on chip).


Required Properties:

- compatible: GRF should be one of the following:
   - compatible = "rockchip,rk3288-service-bus", "syscon";
- reg: physical base address of the controller and length of memory mapped
  region.

Example:

	service_bus: syscon@ffac0000 {
		compatible = "rockchip,rk3288-service-bus", "syscon";
		reg = <0x0 0xffac0000 0x0 0x2000>;
	};
