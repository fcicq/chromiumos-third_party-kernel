* Mediatek Cache Coherent Interconnect(CCI) frequency device

Required properties:
- compatible: should contain "mediatek,mt8183-cci" for frequency scaling of CCI
- clocks: for frequency scaling of CCI
- clock-names: for frequency scaling of CCI driver to reference
- regulator: for voltage scaling of CCI
- operating-points-v2: for frequency scaling of CCI opp table

Example:
	cci: cci {
		compatible = "mediatek,cci";
		clocks = <&apmixedsys CLK_APMIXED_CCIPLL>;
		clock-names = "cci_clock";
		operating-points-v2 = <&cci_opp>;
	};

	&cci {
		proc-supply = <&mt6358_vproc12_reg>;
	};
