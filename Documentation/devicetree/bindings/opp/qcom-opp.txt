Qualcomm OPP bindings to descibe OPP nodes with corner/level values

OPP tables for devices on Qualcomm platforms require an additional
platform specific corner/level value to be specified.
This value is passed on to the RPM (Resource Power Manager) by
the CPU, which then takes the necessary actions to set a voltage
rail to an appropriate voltage based on the value passed.

The bindings are based on top of the operating-points-v2 bindings
described in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/opp/opp.txt
Additional properties are described below.

* OPP Table Node

Required properties:
- compatible: Allow OPPs to express their compatibility. It should be:
  "operating-points-v2-qcom-level"

* OPP Node

Required properties:
- qcom,level: On Qualcomm platforms an OPP node can describe a positive value
representing a corner/level that's communicated with a remote microprocessor
(usually called the RPM) which then translates it into a certain voltage on
a voltage rail.
