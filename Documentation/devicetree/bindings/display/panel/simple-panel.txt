Simple display panel
====================

panel node
----------

Required properties:
- power-supply: See panel-common.txt

Optional properties:
- ddc-i2c-bus: phandle of an I2C controller used for DDC EDID probing
- enable-gpios: GPIO pin to enable or disable the panel
- backlight: phandle of the backlight device attached to the panel
- no-hpd: This panel is supposed to communicate that it's ready via HPD
  (hot plug detect) signal, but the signal isn't hooked up so we should
  hardcode the max delay from the panel spec when powering up the panel.

panel-timing subnode
--------------------

This optional subnode is for devices which require a mode differing
from the panel's "typical" display timing.

Format information on the panel-timing subnode can be found in
display-timing.txt.


Example:

	panel: panel {
		compatible = "cptt,claa101wb01";
		ddc-i2c-bus = <&panelddc>;

		power-supply = <&vdd_pnl_reg>;
		enable-gpios = <&gpio 90 0>;

		backlight = <&backlight>;

		panel-timing {
			clock-frequency = <266604720>;
			hactive = <2400>;
			hfront-porch = <48>;
			hback-porch = <84>;
			hsync-len = <32>;
			vactive = <1600>;
			vfront-porch = <3>;
			vback-porch = <120>;
			vsync-len = <10>;
		};
	};
