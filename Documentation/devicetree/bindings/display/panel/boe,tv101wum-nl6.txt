Boe Corporation 10.1" WUXGA TFT LCD panel

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "boe,tv101wum-nl6"
- reg: the virtual channel number of a DSI peripheral
- enable-gpios: a GPIO spec for the enable pin
- pp1800-supply: core voltage supply
- avdd-supply: phandle of the regulator that provides positive voltage
- avee-supply: phandle of the regulator that provides negative voltage
- backlight: phandle of the backlight device attached to the panel

The device node can contain one 'port' child node with one child
'endpoint' node, according to the bindings defined in
media/video-interfaces.txt. This node should describe panel's video bus.

Example:
&dsi {
	...
	panel@0 {
		compatible = "boe,tv101wum-nl6";
		reg = <0>;
		enable-gpios = <&pio 45 0>;
		avdd-supply = <&ppvarn_lcd>;
		avee-supply = <&ppvarp_lcd>;
		pp1800-supply = <&pp1800_lcd>;
		backlight = <&backlight_lcd0>;
		status = "okay";
		port {
			panel_in: endpoint {
				remote-endpoint = <&dsi_out>;
			};
		};
	};
};
