Rockchip IOMMU
==============

A Rockchip DRM iommu translates io virtual addresses to physical addresses for
its master device.  Each slave device is bound to a single master device, and
shares its clocks, power domain and irq.

Required properties:
- compatible      : Should be "rockchip,iommu"
- reg             : Address space for the configuration registers
- interrupts      : Interrupt specifier for the IOMMU instance
- interrupt-names : Interrupt name for the IOMMU instance
- #iommu-cells    : Should be <0>.  This indicates the iommu is a
                    "single-master" device, and needs no additional information
                    to associate with its master device.  See:
                    Documentation/devicetree/bindings/iommu/iommu.txt
Optional properties:
- clocks : A list of master clocks requires for the IOMMU to be accessible
           by the host CPU. The number of clocks depends on the master
           block and might as well be zero. See [1] for generic clock
           bindings description.

[1] Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt

Optional properties:
- rockchip,disable-mmu-reset : Don't use the mmu reset operation.
			       Some mmu instances may produce unexpected results
			       when the reset operation is used.

Example:

	vopl_mmu: iommu@ff940300 {
		compatible = "rockchip,iommu";
		reg = <0xff940300 0x100>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 16 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		interrupt-names = "vopl_mmu";
		clocks = <&cru ACLK_VOP1>, <&cru DCLK_VOP1>, <&cru HCLK_VOP1>;
		#iommu-cells = <0>;
	};
