MSM Restart Driver

A power supply hold (ps-hold) bit is set to power the msm chipsets.
Clearing that bit allows us to restart/poweroff. The difference
between poweroff and restart is determined by unique power manager IC
settings.

Required Properties:
-compatible: "qcom,pshold"
-reg: Specifies the physical address of the ps-hold register
Optional Properties:
-qcom,dload-mode: phandle to the TCSR hardware block and offset of the
		 download mode control register

Example:

	restart@fc4ab000 {
		compatible = "qcom,pshold";
		reg = <0xfc4ab000 0x4>;
	};
