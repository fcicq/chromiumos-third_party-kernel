* Mediatek Face Detection Unit (FD)

Face Detection (FD) unit is a typical memory-to-memory HW device.
It provides hardware accelerated face detection function, and it
is able to detect different poses of faces. FD will writre result
of detected face into memory as output.

Required properties:
- compatible: "mediatek,mt8183-fd"
- mediatek,scp : the node of system control processor (SCP), see
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/remoteproc/mtk,scp.txt for details.
- iommus: should point to the 3 entries:  M4U_PORT_CAM_FDVT_RP,
  M4U_PORT_CAM_FDVT_WR and M4U_PORT_CAM_FDVT_RB.  (Please see
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/iommu/mediatek,iommu.txt for details.)
- reg: Physical base address and length of the register space.
- interrupts: interrupt number to the cpu.
- clocks : must contain the FDVT clock, see
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt for details.
- clock-names: must be "fd".
- power-domain: must be "MT8183_POWER_DOMAIN_ISP".

Example:
	fd: fd@1502b000 {
		compatible = "mediatek,mt8183-fd";
		mediatek,scp = <&scp>;
		iommus = <&iommu M4U_PORT_CAM_FDVT_RP>,
			 <&iommu M4U_PORT_CAM_FDVT_WR>,
			 <&iommu M4U_PORT_CAM_FDVT_RB>;
		reg = <0 0x1502b000 0 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 269 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW>;
		clocks = <&imgsys CLK_IMG_FDVT>;
		clock-names = "fd";
		power-domains = <&scpsys MT8183_POWER_DOMAIN_ISP>;
	};
