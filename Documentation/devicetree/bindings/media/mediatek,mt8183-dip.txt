* Mediatek Digital Image Processor (DIP)

Digital Image Processor (DIP) unit in Mediatek ISP system is responsible for
image content adjustment according to the tuning parameters. DIP can process
the image form memory buffer and output the processed image to multiple output
buffers. Furthermore, it can support demosaicing and noise reduction on the
images.

Required properties:
- compatible: "mediatek,mt8183-dip"
- reg: Physical base address and length of the function block register space
- interrupts: interrupt number to the cpu
- iommus: should point to the respective IOMMU block with master port as
  argument, see Documentation/devicetree/bindings/iommu/mediatek,iommu.txt
  for details.
- mediatek,mdp3: should point to the respective mdp block. DIP hardware
  connects to MDP and we can get the processed image with both effect of the
  two blocks.
- mediatek,larb: must contain the local arbiters in the current SoCs, see
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/memory-controllers/mediatek,smi-larb.txt
  for details.
- mediatek,scp: should point to the scp node since the we use SCP
  coprocessor to control DIP hardware
- clocks: must contain the local arbiters 5 (LARB5) and DIP clock
- clock-names: must contain "larb5" and "dip"

Example:
	dip: dip@15022000 {
		compatible = "mediatek,mt8183-dip";
		mediatek,larb = <&larb5>;
		mediatek,mdp3 = <&mdp_rdma0>;
		mediatek,scp = <&scp>;
		iommus = <&iommu M4U_PORT_CAM_IMGI>;
		reg = <0 0x15022000 0 0x6000>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 268 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW>;
		clocks = <&imgsys CLK_IMG_LARB5>,
			 <&imgsys CLK_IMG_DIP>;
		clock-names = "larb5",
			      "dip";
		};
