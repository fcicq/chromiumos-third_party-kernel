* Mediatek Image Signal Processor Pass 1 (ISP P1)

The Pass 1 unit of Mediatek's camera ISP system grabs the sensor data out
from the sensor interface, applies ISP effects from tuning data and outputs
the image data and statistics data to DRAM. Furthermore, Pass 1 unit has
the ability to output two different resolutions frames at the same time to
increase the performance of the camera application.

Required properties:
- compatible: Must be "mediatek,mt8183-camisp" for MT8183.
- reg: Physical base address of the camera function block register and
  length of memory mapped region. Must contain an entry for each entry
  in reg-names.
- reg-names: Must include the following entries:
  "cam_sys": Camera base function block
  "cam_uni": Camera UNI function block
  "cam_a": Camera ISP P1 hardware unit A
  "cam_b": Camera ISP P1 hardware unit B
  "cam_c": Camera ISP P1 hardware unit C
- interrupts: Must contain an entry for each entry in interrupt-names.
- interrupt-names : Must include the following entries:
  "cam_uni": Camera UNI interrupt
  "cam_a": Camera unit A interrupt
  "cam_b": Camera unit B interrupt
  "cam_c": Camera unit C interrupt
- iommus: Shall point to the respective IOMMU block with master port
  as argument, see Documentation/devicetree/bindings/iommu/mediatek,iommu.txt
  for details.
- clocks: A list of phandle and clock specifier pairs as listed
  in clock-names property, see
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt for details.
- clock-names: Must be "camsys_cam_cgpdn" and "camsys_camtg_cgpdn".
- mediatek,larb: Must contain the local arbiters in the current SoCs, see
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/memory-controllers/mediatek,smi-larb.txt
  for details.
- power-domains: a phandle to the power domain, see
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/power/power_domain.txt for details.
- mediatek,scp : The node of system control processor (SCP), see
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/remoteproc/mtk,scp.txt for details.
