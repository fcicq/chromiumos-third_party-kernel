* Mediatek seninf MIPI-CSI2 host driver

Seninf MIPI-CSI2 host driver is a HW camera interface controller. It support a widely adopted,
simple, high-speed protocol primarily intended for point-to-point image and video
transmission between cameras and host devices.

Required properties:
  - compatible: "mediatek,mt8183-seninf"
  - reg: Must contain an entry for each entry in reg-names.
  - reg-names: Must include the following entries:
    "base_reg": seninf registers base
    "rx_reg": Rx analog registers base
  - interrupts: interrupt number to the cpu.
  - clocks : clock name from clock manager
  - clock-names: must be CLK_CAM_SENINF and CLK_TOP_MUX_SENINF.
    It is the clocks of seninf

Example:
	seninf: seninf@1a040000 {
		compatible = "mediatek,mt8183-seninf";
		reg = <0 0x1a040000 0 0x8000>,
		      <0 0x11C80000 0 0x6000>;
		reg-names = "base_reg", "rx_reg";
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 251 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW>;
		power-domains = <&scpsys MT8183_POWER_DOMAIN_CAM>;
		clocks = <&camsys CLK_CAM_SENINF>,
			 <&topckgen CLK_TOP_MUX_SENINF>;
		clock-names = "CLK_CAM_SENINF", "CLK_TOP_MUX_SENINF";
	}
