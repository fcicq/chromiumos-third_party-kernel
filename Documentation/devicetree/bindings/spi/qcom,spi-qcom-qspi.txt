QTI [Qualcomm Technologies Inc] Quad Serial Peripheral Interface (QSPI)

QSPI [Quad Serial Peripheral Interface] allows single dual and quad read/write
access to slaves. QTI's QSPI controller implements the QSPI protocol to interface
with slaves like NOR Flash devices.

Required properties:
- compatible:	Should contain:
		"qcom,qspi-v1"
- reg:		Contains the base register location and length
- interrupts:	Interrupt number used by the controller.
- clocks:	Contains the core and AHB clock names.
- clock-names:	"core" for core clock and "iface" for AHB clock.
- spi-max-frequency:	Maximum SPI core clock frequency in Hz.

SPI slave nodes must be children of the SPI master node and can contain
properties described in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/spi/spi-bus.txt

Example:

	qspi: qspi@7418000 {
		compatible = "qcom,qspi-v1";
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		reg = <0x7418000 0x600>;
		interrupts = <0 459 0>;
		clock-names = "iface", "core";
		clocks = <&clock_gcc clk_gcc_qspi_ahb_clk>,
			 <&clock_gcc clk_gcc_qspi_ser_clk>;

		device@0 {
			compatible = "dummy_device";
			reg = <x>; /* CS for the device */
			spi-max-frequency = <f>; /* Max supported frequency of the slave (Hz) */
		};
	};
