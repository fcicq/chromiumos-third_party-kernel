	select VHOST
	---help---
	  This kernel module can be loaded in host kernel to accelerate
	  guest networking with virtio_net. Not to be confused with virtio_net
	  module itself which needs to be loaded in guest kernel.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will
	  be called vhost_net.

	Say M here to enable the vhost_scsi TCM fabric module
	for use with virtio-scsi guests

	---help---
	This kernel module can be loaded in the host kernel to provide AF_VSOCK
	sockets for communicating with guests.  The guests must have the
	virtio_transport.ko driver loaded to use the virtio-vsock device.

	To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be called
	vhost_vsock.
