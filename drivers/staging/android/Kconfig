config ANDROID
	bool "Android Drivers"
	---help---
	  Enable support for various drivers needed on the Android platform

if ANDROID

config ANDROID_BINDER_IPC
	bool "Android Binder IPC Driver"
	depends on MMU
	default n
	---help---
	  Binder is used in Android for both communication between processes,
	  and remote method invocation.

	  This means one Android process can call a method/routine in another
	  Android process, using Binder to identify, invoke and pass arguments
	  between said processes.

config ANDROID_BINDER_IPC_32BIT
	bool
	depends on !64BIT && ANDROID_BINDER_IPC
	default y
	---help---
	  The Binder API has been changed to support both 32 and 64bit
	  applications in a mixed environment.

	  Enable this to support an old 32-bit Android user-space (v4.4 and
	  earlier).

	  Note that enabling this will break newer Android user-space.

config ANDROID_BINDER_DEVICES
	string "Android Binder devices"
	depends on ANDROID_BINDER_IPC
	default "binder,hwbinder,vndbinder"
	---help---
	  Default value for the binder.devices parameter.

	  The binder.devices parameter is a comma-separated list of strings
	  that specifies the names of the binder device nodes that will be
	  created. Each binder device has its own context manager, and is
	  therefore logically separated from the other devices.

config ANDROID_BINDER_IPC_SELFTEST
        bool "Android Binder IPC Driver Selftest"
        depends on ANDROID_BINDER_IPC
        ---help---
          This feature allows binder selftest to run.

          Binder selftest checks the allocation and free of binder buffers
          exhaustively with combinations of various buffer sizes and
          alignments.

config ASHMEM
	bool "Enable the Anonymous Shared Memory Subsystem"
	default n
	depends on SHMEM
	---help---
	  The ashmem subsystem is a new shared memory allocator, similar to
	  POSIX SHM but with different behavior and sporting a simpler
	  file-based API.

	  It is, in theory, a good memory allocator for low-memory devices,
	  because it can discard shared memory units when under memory pressure.

config ANDROID_TIMED_OUTPUT
	bool "Timed output class driver"
	default y

config ANDROID_TIMED_GPIO
	tristate "Android timed gpio driver"
	depends on GPIOLIB && ANDROID_TIMED_OUTPUT
	default n
        ---help---
	  Unlike generic gpio is to allow programs to access and manipulate gpio
	  registers from user space, timed output/gpio is a system to allow changing
	  a gpio pin and restore it automatically after a specified timeout.

config ANDROID_LOW_MEMORY_KILLER
	bool "Android Low Memory Killer"
	---help---
	  Registers processes to be killed when low memory conditions, this is useful
	  as there is no particular swap space on android.

	  The registered process will kill according to the priorities in android init
	  scripts (/init.rc), and it defines priority values with minimum free memory size
	  for each priority.

config ANDROID_LOW_MEMORY_KILLER_AUTODETECT_OOM_ADJ_VALUES
	bool "Android Low Memory Killer: detect oom_adj values"
	depends on ANDROID_LOW_MEMORY_KILLER
	default y
	---help---
	  Detect oom_adj values written to
	  /sys/module/lowmemorykiller/parameters/adj and convert them
	  to oom_score_adj values.

config ANDROID_BCB
	tristate "Bootloader Control Block module"
	default n
	---help---
	  This driver installs a reboot hook, such that if reboot() is invoked
	  with a string argument NNN, "bootonce-NNN" is copied to the command
	  field in the Bootloader Control Block on the /misc partition, to be
	  read by the bootloader. If the string matches one of the boot labels
	  defined in its configuration, it will boot once into that label. The
	  device and partition number are specified on the kernel command line.

config SW_SYNC
	bool "Software synchronization framework"
	default n
	depends on SYNC
	depends on SYNC_FILE
	depends on DEBUG_FS
	---help---
	  A sync object driver that uses a 32bit counter to coordinate
	  synchronization.  Useful when there is no hardware primitive backing
	  the synchronization.

	  WARNING: improper use of this can result in deadlocking kernel
	  drivers from userspace. Intended for test and debug only.
